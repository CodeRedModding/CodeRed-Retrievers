## CodeRed Retrievers

Used by [CodeRed Launcher](https://github.com/CodeRedModding/CodeRed-Launcher) and by the internal module itself, this repository is used for storing and retrieving values.

All of the logos, banners, and textures, excluding the news article thumbnails used by the launcher, I created myself. They are not copyrighted and fall under the same MIT license that this repo does.
