	"ModuleChangelog": "Fixed a crash with the reflector window related to reading specific structs in TArrays due to incorrectly calculating class alignment for byte and bool properties, such as the `PlayerInput_TA` class.\nFixed the `freeplay_car_rotation` and `freeplay_ball_rotation` commands printing out raw unclamped rotator values, even though the command to set them only accepts -180 to 180 values.\nFixed some scenarios where your CodeRed loadouts weren't applying on the end game podium celebration screen.\nUpdated the internal SDK to the latest version of Rocket League.",
