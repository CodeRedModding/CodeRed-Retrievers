	"ModuleChangelog": "The `stadium_disable_filters` setting now also disables color desaturation, turns out some maps do that for some reason.\nPossibly fixed a bug that made playlists on the main menu appear disabled, might have been related to waiting on the start menu before the game could auth you in.\nFixed a couple random map images that weren't showing up in in Discord rich presence for some reason.\nInternal optimizations and miscellaneous bug fixes.",
