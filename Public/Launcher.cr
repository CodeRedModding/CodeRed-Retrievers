	"LauncherChangelog": "Upgraded from `.NET 8.0` to `.NET 9.0`, which will require you to download the new runtime if you only have `.NET 8.0` installed.\nAdded a new category section in the news tab to indicate what the news article is about without having to click on it.\nChanged the default injection time from 20 seconds to 2.5 seconds, which I forgot to do a long time ago.\nReduced the memory footprint of the news tab by more than 1/4th related to images and caching.",

	"ModuleChangelog": "Enabled custom avatars again, custom playlist images are still being worked on.\nThe maximum allowed size for loading custom player avatars has been reduced from 512x512 to 256x256.\nRemoved the ability to make layered avatars like you could with banners, this is a limitation of the new avatar system.\nTexture formats BC1 through BC5 can now be exported to any extension instead of being limited to `.dds`.\nFixed the texture browser window only showing UTexture2D's instead of all possible texture objects.\nFixed overlay windows, such as the session tracker, not properly scaling according to the `imgui_global_scale` setting.\nFixed a crash with the reflector window related to viewing TArray structs that had byte properties in them.\nFixed your Discord rich presence state saying `Idling` if you were in spectator mode.\nRemade the entire internal API endpoint to be more efficient and reliable.\nFurther improvements to the platform and steam avatar system.",
