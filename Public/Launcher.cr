    "LauncherChangelog": "Added a new loading screen window when changing install paths, as it may take some time to copy and move everything.\nFixed the user being able to change install paths while CodeRed was injected in the game.\nInternal code refactoring and improvements.",
    "ModuleChangelog": "Added a new `Vantablack (Black Grey)` style, which is an extra dark mode version of the default style.\nRefined the color palettes in all the default styles slightly to be more consistent, as well as the special `Duotone` terminal themes.\nYou can no longer set window backgrounds or text to be fully transparent in custom styles, as Th3Ant tried exactly that and couldn't see any windows anymore (who woulda thought?).\nRemoved the legacy `Pitch Black` style, as it was a bit of an eye sore and no one used it anyway.\nRemoved the settings to customize blog info (other than the MotD), as they have been broken for a long time and I don't plan on fixing them.\nFixed the main menu background restoring back its default one when idling on the main menu, if you had a different one selected in CodeRed.\nFixed the `interface_hide_seasonrewards` setting sometimes not applying after a game ended and your rewards updated.\nFixed yet another loading screen crash related to the matchmaker window grabbing playlist nodes in the background.\nFixed a rare crash that could happen on injection related to not finding global objects or names.\nUpgraded the internal ImGui framework to version 1.9.1.\nStability improvements and internal optimizations.",
