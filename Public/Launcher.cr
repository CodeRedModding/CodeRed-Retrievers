    "LauncherChangelog": "Upgraded from `.NET 7.0` to `.NET 8.0`, which will require you to download the new runtime if you only have `.NET 7.0` installed.\nAdded more files and extra logging info for the crash dump exporter.\nFixed not finding a folder path bug on first install, which would require restarting the launcher.\nFixed the manual inject button not working sometimes, as well as it ignoring the `prevent injection when out of date` setting.",
    "ModuleChangelog": "You will no longer be able to use CodeRed if you have less than 4gb of vram or less than 8gb of system ram.\nDisabled 3D scene slots in thumbnail renderer for non-nvidia gpus, Intel and AMD stopped working a few months back (thanks for that Psyonix...).\nThe thumbnail renderer will now be unusable when you're not on the main menu, both the window and terminal commands.\nAdded a new setting for custom styles called `TableHeaderAngle` under the `Technical` header.\nAdded preparations for when trading gets removed on December 5th, trading features will get hidden automatically in case I'm late.\nFixed player avatars on Steam not showing their correct profile picture on the scoreboard.\nFixed your selected preset in the garage tab sometimes defaulting to the `Autosave Preset` after injecting.\nFixed the `interface_custom_motd` setting sometimes not applying when you reset your car in freeplay.\nFixed the `replay_disable_ads` setting not working if you changing the setting while in a replay and tried reloading into the replay.\nPossibly fixed the `freeplay_clear_overrides` setting not working for some people in freeplay (requires testing).\nUpgraded the internal ImGui framework to version 1.9.0.\nInternal optimizations and stability improvements.",
