    "LauncherChangelog": "Added a `already running` warning if you try to open more than one launcher at once, which asks if you wish to continue or exit.\nMade all custom controls double buffered, UI elements should now be a lot smoother.\nChanged the font size of the changelog box to be slightly smaller to fit more text.\nFixed some popups being in dark mode despite having the light mode setting enabled.\nFixed the installer popup not having any fancy graphics like all of the other popups.\nFixed the news tab not defaulting to display the very first news article downloaded.\nAdditional safety improvements regarding reading and writing to file paths.",
    "ModuleChangelog": "The stadium_disable_filters setting now disables image grain on all maps, turns out a lot of maps have this effect on them.\nEnabled the auto replay saver settings again after some bug fixes, will I ever properly fix this feature? Stay tuned to find out.\nAdded an example custom avatar border texture, HappyFatOtaku, that I ripped from the Chinese version of the game.\nUpdated the custom CodeRed banner textures to match the font used in the new logo.\nAdjusted the color schemes in the default styles slightly to match the new launcher better.\nFixed your selected title from garage presets not applying during goal replays sometimes in freeplay.\nFixed a bug that caused custom textures to not update instantly when selecting different files in the Textures tab.\nFixed a bug with custom textures if you selected the same one for a color layer and the normal layer, resulting in both being colored.\nFixed a bug with the interface_auto_reset_buffer setting which reset your input multiple times after scoring a goal.\nOptimizations with memory allocation, and also possibly fixed a memory leak issue.",
