	"ModuleChangelog": "Added the new `Salty Shores (Salty Fest)` map to the main menu background changer.\nAdded Discord rich presence integration, see the `interface` tab for all the available settings (credit to Segal for creating the dummy dll).\nYour CodeRed border and banners will no longer be applied when entering the `profile` menu in the garage, this is to prevent a crash that could occur.\nThe texture browser window now automatically refresh upon loading screens to prevent trying to export a texture that no longer exists.\nImproved displaying mmr on the playlist select menu, sometimes you'd have to go in and out of the menu for it to apply which has been fixed.\nImproved the internal safety system for injecting the dll really early, sometimes CodeRed would fail to initialize.\nChanged the ImGui notification system to use textures for icons instead of emojis.\nUpdated the gamestate debugger to include rich presence info.\nUpdated internal SDK to the latest version of Rocket League.\nUpgraded the internal ImGui framework to version 1.9.7.",
