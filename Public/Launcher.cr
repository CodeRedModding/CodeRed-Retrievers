	"LauncherChangelog": "Fixed an infinite loop message box that occurred if you tried to run the launcher without having Rocket League installed.",
	"NewsUrl": "https://www.rocketleague.com/en/news/",
	"ModuleChangelog": "Added a new command `freeplay_spawn_ball` which lets you spawn multiple balls in freeplay.\nAdded a few more additional checks for the invisible car exploit, as it would appear Psyonix still hasn't fully fixed it. If you encounter someone invisible remember to save the reply!\nFixed an audio bug when tabbing back into the game if you had the `mute on unfocused` setting on, the game would think you were still unfocused if an ImGui window was open.\nFixed the `stadium_disable_filters` not detecting you were in the correct map, for example removing the cartoony lighting for the `Fire & Ice` map wasn't working.\nFixed CodeRed thinking you were in freeplay while playing in workshop maps, I still made the `use default colors` freeplay setting still work however.\nFixed a crash that could happen when spamming the open scoreboard button right after joining an online game.\nStability improvements and optimizations with custom textures.",
