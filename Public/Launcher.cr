    "LauncherChangelog": "Upgraded from `.NET 7.0` to `.NET 8.0`, which will require you to download the new runtime if you only have `.NET 7.0` installed.\nAdded more files and extra logging info for the crash dump exporter.\nFixed not finding a folder path bug on first install, which would require restarting the launcher.\nFixed the manual inject button not working sometimes, as well as it ignoring the `prevent injection when out of date` setting.",
    "ModuleChangelog": "If you don't meet the min system specs a new popup will appear asking if you wish to continue or not, despite the chance of crashing.\nChanges to how share codes are parsed and generated as preparation for an upcoming update.\nFixed a bug that could sometimes detect your cpus integrated graphics for vram instead of your gpu.\nFixed the `garage_apply_presets` setting not restoring your original items if you called it through the terminal instead of the dashboard.\nOther internal bug fixes that don't need mentioning and aren't embarrassing at all.\nRemoved the `brank_eggnog` command which hired a British person to make you Eggnog in your own home for the holidays, which resulted in several people getting salmonella poisoning due to raw unpasteurized eggs.",
