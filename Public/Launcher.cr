	"LauncherChangelog": "Fixed the `Launch Rocket League` button being visible if you were on Epic, this was supposed to be for Steam only.",
	"ModuleChangelog": "Added two new commands `matchmaking_select_id` and `matchmaking_deselect_id` that let you select playlists on the main menu by their id instead of row index.\nFixed the tab colors being wrong in some windows, this was due to me not accounting for some new color ids as of the last ImGui update.\nFixed tournament and private showing up with incorrect info for Discord rich presence, also matches will now show proper team sizes if players leave.\nInternal bug fixes and performance improvements."
