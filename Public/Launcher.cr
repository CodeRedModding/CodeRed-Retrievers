	"ModuleChangelog": "Temporarily disabled custom player avatars while I work on a fix for them being destroyed randomly after scoring goals.\nAdded a new setting `garage_patch_invisible` which attempts to detect and patch people using invisible loadout hacks. Before this was hardcoded in but it can now be turned on or off.\nFixed some cars in online matches randomly having the stocktane preset applied to them despite not using any anonymizer settings.\nFixed some titles not restoring to their original colors on the scoreboard if you disabled loadouts mid-game.\nFixed a rare thread racing crash that could happen with the reflector window and clearing instances.\nFixed the `freeplay_goal_speed` setting spamming the balls speed in chat in online matches.\nFixed the matchmaker window missing some limited time events and the new Split Shot modes.\nInternal bug fixes and optimizations related to API requests.\nUpgraded the internal ImGui framework to version 1.91.8.",
