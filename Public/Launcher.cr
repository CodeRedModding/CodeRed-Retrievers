	"ModuleChangelog": "Added the ability to make custom titles! The custom title system is free to use for everyone, and can only be seen by you by default just like CodeRed loadouts.\nAdded a new database dumper command `database_dump_psynet`, along with five new arguments for it that let you dump info from the RPC services the game uses.\nThe car body used to replace the Cybertruck, for the `garage_remove_elon` setting, will now be randomly picked between each game instead of always being the Venom car.\nThe loadout anonymizer will no longer anonymize goal explosions, as some have special effects that change the gravity; which resulted in rubber banding during goal explosions.\nRemoved the `scoreboard_uncensor_names` setting as it no longer works as intended, Psyonix broke their own persona system awhile back.\nChanged the primary color picker to be all in one row for the blue and orange team, instead of in separate tabs.\nReorganized the textures tab in the dashboard to be a bit more intuitive.\nSignificant memory optimizations and improvements related to custom textures in addition to API requests.\nFixed end of game automation features still being called if you joined another game before the delay was finished.\nFixed CodeRed switching to offline mode if an update was released while you were already injected.\nFixed some text cutting cut off in the bindings window in the dashboard for custom sequences.\nFixed trails not working in game for CodeRed loadouts (it's about time)."
