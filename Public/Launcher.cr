	"ModuleChangelog": "Added a new `Unreal Reflector` window for developers, this tool lets you view game objects and their properties in real time.\nAdded a new database dump argument for offline products, `product_attribute_names`, which prints its attribute names if any are found.\nAdded over 20 new product attribute arguments for the database dumper, check the wiki for a full list of arguments and examples.\nRenamed the database argument `online_attribute_string` to `online_attribute_names` for consistency reasons.\nFixed the database dumper not escaping some specific special characters, turns out Psyonix likes to add random escape characters to strings for no reason.\nFixed the `garage_remove_elon` setting causing your car to have the `mystery cloth` stuck on it after revealing drops.\nFixed the connections window not displaying account ids as of the last Rocket League update.\nInternal bug fixes and lots of code refactoring.",
