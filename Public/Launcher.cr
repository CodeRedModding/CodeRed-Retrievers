	"LauncherChangelog": "Added the news tab back in the launcher, with a fallback incase Psyonix keeps blocking the launcher from downloading news.\nFixed the update popup getting stuck open if an error occurred while downloading, now if an error happens it will ask you if you want to try again.\nFixed a crash that could happen when spamming the previous and next buttons in the news back too fast.",
