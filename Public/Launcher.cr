    "LauncherChangelog": "Upgraded from `.NET 7.0` to `.NET 8.0`, which will require you to download the new runtime if you only have `.NET 7.0` installed.\nAdded more files and extra logging info for the crash dump exporter.\nFixed not finding a folder path bug on first install, which would require restarting the launcher.\nFixed the manual inject button not working sometimes, as well as it ignoring the `prevent injection when out of date` setting.",
    "ModuleChangelog": "Remade all the custom example playlist textures to match the games new UI.\nRemade the matchmaker window to be fully dynamic, you can now search limited time events and rotating competitive playlists that match the games new UI.\nYou can now change where notifications appear with the `imgui_notification_corner` setting. 1 is top right, 2 is top left, 3 is bottom left, and 4 is bottom right.\nThe gamestate debugger can now be repositioned just like the session tracker, hold ctrl and double right click on the window for options.\nFixed profiles sometimes not applying fully when first loading into freeplay or custom training packs.\nFixed the population stats setting not displaying the correct numbers, it was adding the wrong playlists together that you had selected.\nFixed mmr gain and losses showing raw html in playlist descriptions, thanks for removing colored text Psyonix...\nFixed custom playlist info and mmr sometimes not applying on the main menu if you switched between menus.\nFixed the session tracker and gamestate windows showing your cursor on screen due to the last ImGui update.\nOther internal improvements and bug fixes.",
