	"LauncherChangelog": "Added more detailed info to the update window when installing updates.\nChanged some error messages and logs to provide better info if something is blocking the launchers permissions.",
	"ModuleChangelog": "Added the new `1966 Cadillac DeVille` car body to the anonymizer setting `garage_hide_loadouts`.\nRenamed all the manager commands, for example `manager_reset_setting` has been renamed to just `reset_setting`.\nOnline stadium colors will now also be applied in custom lan matches as opposed to freeplay colors.\nFixed the `freeplay_pad_cooldown` and `freeplay_pill_cooldown` settings not applying when joining or respawning in freeplay.\nFixed a crash that could happen when changing profile items in game and going back and forth through menus really fast.\nFixed a crash that could happen with the `skill corrected` ImGui notification as of the last update.\nFixed custom paint colors not applying in game for a select few car bodies or being inconsistent.\nFixed certain titles not restoring properly if you disabled CodeRed loadouts mid-game.\nInternal optimizations and performance improvements.",
