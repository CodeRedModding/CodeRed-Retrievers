	"ModuleChangelog": "Added a new `Unreal Reflector` window for developers, this tool lets you view game objects and their properties in real time.\nAdded a new database dump argument for offline products, `product_attribute_names`, which prints its attribute names if any are found.\nAdded over 20 new product attribute arguments for the database dumper, check the wiki for a full list of arguments and examples.\nRenamed the database argument `online_attribute_string` to `online_attribute_names` for consistency reasons.\nFixed the database dumper not escaping some specific special characters, turns out Psyonix likes to add random escape characters to strings for no reason.\nFixed the `garage_remove_elon` setting causing your car to have the `mystery cloth` stuck on it after revealing drops.\nFixed the connections window not displaying account ids as of the last Rocket League update.\nInternal bug fixes and lots of code refactoring.",
	"LauncherChangelog": "Upgraded from `.NET 8.0` to `.NET 9.0`, which will require you to download the new runtime if you only have `.NET 8.0` installed.\nAdded a new category section in the news tab to indicate what the news article is about without having to click on it.\nChanged the default injection time from 20 seconds to 2.5 seconds, which I forgot to do a long time ago.\nReduced the memory footprint of the news tab by more than 1/4th related to images and caching.",
