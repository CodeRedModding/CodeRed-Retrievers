    "ModuleChangelog": "Added a new ImGui window called `clock`, which displays the current time in the top left of your screen.\nAdded a new setting `imgui_draw_clock`, which automatically opens the new `clock` window on injection.\nAdded a new setting `imgui_clock_24`, which is true by default. If set to false, timestamps will use a 12 hour AM/PM clock instead of a 24 hour one.\nPossibly fixed a random crash that happened if you changed your nickname in the Steam overlay while in a game.\nFixed the game not closing properly if you had the `keys_rage_quits` setting enabled and used `Alt+F4` to close the game.\nFixed a crash that happened if you left a game before it finished completely, or forfeited early.\nFixed the refresh button in the texture browser window not applying the text in the filter box.",
