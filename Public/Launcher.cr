	"ModuleChangelog": "Added a new setting `imgui_scanner_origin`, which lets you see where a function was called from (ProcessEvent, ProcessInternal, or CallFunction).\nRemade the function scanner window both visually and internally to be much more optimized, as well as added a new settings tab to it.\nRemade the sequence window in the bindings tab to be easier to use, sequences let you bind multiple commands or actions to a single custom command.\nFixed a crash that happened if you used any of the custom chat commands in modes that didn't have a chat, such as freeplay or custom training.\nFixed a rare bug that caused CodeRed to think your account was cabined before you logged into the game.\nAdditional internal memory optimizations.",

	"LauncherChangelog": "Added a custom caching system for web requests due to GitHubs new rate limits, this should fix possible issues with downloading version info.\nRemade the internal logging system to have a lot more detail.\nInternal code refactoring and memory optimizations."
