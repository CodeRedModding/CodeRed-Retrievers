	"LauncherChangelog": "Added the news tab back in the launcher, with a fallback incase Psyonix keeps blocking the launcher from downloading news.\nFixed the update popup getting stuck open if an error occurred while downloading, now if an error happens it will ask you if you want to try again.\nFixed a crash that could happen when spamming the previous and next buttons in the news back too fast.",

	"ModuleChangelog": "The `stadium_disable_filters` setting now also disables color desaturation, turns out some maps do that for some reason.\nPossibly fixed a bug that made playlists on the main menu appear disabled, might have been related to waiting on the start menu before the game could auth you in.\nFixed a couple random map images that weren't showing up in in Discord rich presence for some reason.\nInternal optimizations and miscellaneous bug fixes.",
