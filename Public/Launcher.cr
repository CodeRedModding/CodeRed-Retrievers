	"ModuleChangelog": "Enabled custom avatars again, custom playlist images are still being worked on.\nThe maximum allowed size for loading custom player avatars has been reduced from 512x512 to 256x256.\nRemoved the ability to make layered avatars like you could with banners, this is a limitation of the new avatar system.\nTexture formats BC1 through BC5 can now be exported to any extension instead of being limited to `.dds`.\nFixed the texture browser window only showing UTexture2D's instead of all possible texture objects.\nFixed overlay windows, such as the session tracker, not properly scaling according to the `imgui_global_scale` setting.\nFixed a crash with the reflector window related to viewing TArray structs that had byte properties in them.\nFixed your Discord rich presence state saying `Idling` if you were in spectator mode.\nRemade the entire internal API endpoint to be more efficient and reliable.\nFurther improvements to the platform and steam avatar system.",
