	"LauncherChangelog": "Added the news tab back in the launcher, with a fallback incase Psyonix keeps blocking the launcher from downloading news.\nFixed the update popup getting stuck open if an error occurred while downloading, now if an error happens it will ask you if you want to try again.\nFixed a crash that could happen when spamming the previous and next buttons in the news back too fast.",

	"ModuleChangelog": "Added two new commands `matchmaking_select_id` and `matchmaking_deselect_id` that let you select playlists on the main menu by their id instead of row index.\nFixed the tab colors being wrong in some windows, this was due to me not accounting for some new color ids as of the last ImGui update.\nFixed tournament and private showing up with incorrect info for Discord rich presence, also matches will now show proper team sizes if players leave.\nInternal bug fixes and performance improvements."
