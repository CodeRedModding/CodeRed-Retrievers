- Loaded Modules (e.g., dynamic-link library files) currently injected into Rocket League at runtime.

- To provide CodeRed's features and ensure proper functionality.

We do not sell or rent your information to third parties.

4. Enforcement of Rocket League's Terms of Use

CodeRed is third-party modification that operates in accordance with Rocket League's Terms of Use and End User License Agreement (EULA).

- By using CodeRed, you agree that you must also comply with Rocket League's official terms.
- CodeRedModding reserves the right to restrict or deny use of the mod to individuals who attempt to use it in violation of Rocket League's Terms of Use or for malicious purposes.
- We also reserve the right to deny anyone use of the mod at our sole discretion, even for reasons not explicitly stated in this Privacy Policy or our Terms of Use.
- CodeRed is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or supported by Psyonix LLC or Epic Games, Inc.

- Consent: When you voluntarily use the mod.
- Legitimate Interest: Ensuring the mod functions properly and securely.
- Legal Obligation: Where disclosure is required by law.

6. Data Retention

We retain collected information only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described above. Once no longer needed, we will securely delete or anonymize your data.

7. Data Sharing and Disclosure

We may share your data under the following circumstances:

As CodeRedModding is based in the United States, your information may be transferred and processed outside the European Union. We implement appropriate safeguards, such as Standard Contractual Clauses, to protect your data in accordance with GDPR requirements.

9. Data Security

We implement technical and organizational measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, loss, or misuse. However, no system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute protection.

11. Children's Privacy

CodeRed is not available to children under the age of 13.

Epic Games requires users under the age of 13 to use a cabined account. Because CodeRed cannot be used with cabined accounts, children under 13 are technically restricted from accessing the mod.

We do not knowingly collect any information from children under 13, and any attempt to use CodeRed with a cabined account will not function.

12. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updates will be posted with a revised Last Updated Date.
